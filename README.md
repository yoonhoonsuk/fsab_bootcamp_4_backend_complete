# FSAB Bootcamp 24 Backend Template

## How to use this repo
- Checkout to the branch of your choosing with `git checkout <branchName>` followed by `git pull`. If you're switching to a new branch, run `npm i`. To run the backend, run `npm start`. 
- Branch options:
    - `main` (default): Has almost nothing done for you, just the `.gitignore` file which helps you avoid committing files you don't want to!
    - `express-boilerplate`: Sets up express for you. 
    - `firebase-template`: Sets up firebase for you, almost. You must navigate to `util/FirebaseInit.js` and replace the configuration values with the ones found in your Firebase Project settings. See the handout for more info!
    - `complete`: The completed (most up-to-date) code, for your reference.
